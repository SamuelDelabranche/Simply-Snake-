# Simply Snake(First game in C++)

## Description


The "Snake" project aims to recreate the classic snake game using C++ programming. The objective of the game is to control the snake on the screen, collecting fruits to increase its length and score points. However, the player must avoid hitting the walls of the board or crossing itself, as that would end the game.
